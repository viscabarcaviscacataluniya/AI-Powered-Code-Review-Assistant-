🌍 Carbon Emission Analytics with SQL & Power BI
Interactive analytics and actionable insights on global and country-level carbon emissions.

Built with advanced SQL for data engineering, and Power BI for dynamic visual storytelling.

🔗 Explore the Interactive Dashboard

📈 Project Overview
This solution delivers a robust platform for policymakers, analysts, and sustainability leaders to:

Track carbon emission trends over time,

Benchmark countries by performance,

Identify key sectors and actionable strategies for emission reduction.

The project combines data engineering (SQL) and interactive reporting (Power BI), making complex emission data accessible and actionable.

🏢 Business Problem & Use Case
Challenge:
Global carbon emissions continue to rise, threatening climate stability and economic growth. Organizations and governments need to pinpoint the highest-impact intervention areas, monitor progress, and develop targeted policies based on transparent, up-to-date data.

Solution:
This dashboard provides a unified view of emission history by country and year, sectoral reduction opportunities, and recommended mitigation actions—supporting climate commitments, ESG reporting, and strategic planning.

⚙️ Technology & Methodology
Data Sources:

Kaggle – United Nations Environment Data

UN Environment Programme – Six Sector Solution

Data Engineering:

SQL for ETL, data cleansing, aggregation (SELECT, GROUP BY, JOIN, aggregation functions, CTEs)

Visualization:

Power BI for interactive dashboards (line chart, bar chart, donut chart, multi-row cards, slicer/table)

Smart Narrative for dynamic text summaries

📊 Key Features & Visuals

📌 Impact Metrics (Derived from Dashboard)
Energy sector abatement potential:
Up to 8.2 Gt CO₂ (22.28% of total reduction) can be tackled through energy transition and efficiency programs

Global record emission:
21,966.45 million tonnes (2017)—highest annual total

Peak global per capita emission:
5.3 metric tonnes (2005)

Albania example:

1975 per capita: 4.21 metric tonnes

2017 per capita: 5.15 metric tonnes

22% increase—basis for setting reduction goals

Sector opportunities:

Energy: 22.28%

Agriculture/Food/Land: 18.21%

Buildings & Cities: 16.03%

Transport: 12.77%

Industry: 14.67%

Nature-Solutions: 16.03%

Cross-country benchmarks:
Leading emitters and top performers are clearly ranked for targeted strategy

🌟 Sample Use Cases
Governments:
Pinpoint sectors and years with the greatest reduction opportunities, set national targets, monitor policy impact.

Businesses:
Align ESG goals, target energy efficiency programs, benchmark operations globally.

NGOs/Research:
Track trends, publish insights, and advocate for science-based policy agendas.

🚨 Cautions & Limitations
Data may include estimation or lag due to reporting cycles—decision-makers should verify with multiple sources before committing resources.

Cross-country comparisons should use per capita or GDP normalization for fair assessment.

Dashboards and metrics are updated per available dataset releases.

💡 Business Recommendations (Based on Analysis)
Accelerate transition and investment in renewables and energy-efficient infrastructure for maximum impact (Energy sector: 8.2 Gt CO₂ reduction possible).

Target historic highs to set measurable emission reduction goals (e.g., Albania, 22% decrease to reach 1975 levels).

Combine sectoral approaches—energy, industry, agriculture, and transport—for holistic decarbonization.

Encourage passive/renewable solutions, address methane leaks, upgrade buildings/cities, and implement sustainable agricultural practices for rapid, multi-sector progress.
