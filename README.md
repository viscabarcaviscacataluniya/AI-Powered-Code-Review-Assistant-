🛡️ AI-Powered Code Review Assistant
Smarter code reviews. Fewer bugs. Better teams.
An intelligent, automated code review system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to detect inefficiencies, vulnerabilities, and anti-patterns in pull requests at scale.

🚀 Project Vision
AI-Powered Code Review Assistant aims to automate static code analysis using LLMs and machine learning. Built to integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, the assistant identifies:

🐞 Security vulnerabilities

⚙️ Inefficient logic or design patterns

📉 Code quality issues

🧠 Optimization suggestions

Inspired by real-world codebase challenges and emerging LLM capabilities, this assistant accelerates code review processes while enhancing consistency and safety.

✨ Key Objectives
Detect bugs and performance issues across multiple languages (starting with Python)

Provide inline suggestions, summaries, and security flags

Integrate with GitHub pull requests and developer workflows

Continuously improve via feedback loops from user interactions

🔧 Planned Features
Feature	Status	Description
LLM-powered static analysis	🔄 Planned	Flagging anti-patterns, inefficiencies, security issues
CI/CD pipeline integration	🔄 Planned	GitHub Actions or GitLab CI support
Multi-language support	🔄 Planned	Starting with Python, expanding to JS, C++, etc.
Pull request comment generation	🔄 Planned	Summarized, human-readable suggestions
Security vulnerability scanning	🔄 Planned	OWASP Top 10, common CVEs, dependency alerts

🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
Languages: Python, Bash

LLM Integration: OpenAI/Groq APIs, LangChain

ML/Analysis: Custom rule engine + GPT fine-tuning

Backend: FastAPI

DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions

Database: MySQL (logs, feedback loop)

📈 Use Cases
Individual developers: Instantly detect issues before merging code

Teams: Enforce code quality standards and reduce manual review burden

Startups/Enterprises: Boost productivity, reduce post-deployment bugs

🧪 Example Workflow (Planned)
Developer creates pull request

Assistant analyzes the diff

Findings are added as inline comments or summaries

Developer accepts or rejects suggestions

Feedback loop fine-tunes the model over time
